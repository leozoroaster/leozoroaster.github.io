I'm Zhou Lu, a fourth-year CS PhD student at Princeton University, advised by Professor [Elad Hazan](https://www.ehazan.com/). Before Princeton, I received my bachelor's degree in Math from Peking University, advised by Professor [Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/). I'm interested in machine learning theory.
